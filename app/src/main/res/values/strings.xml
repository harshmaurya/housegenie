    <string name="cost_of_house_explanation">To understand how the cost of buying a house is calculated, consider a hypothetical scenario
        where you sell the house at the end of your loan period. The net cost of ownership is total of emi and downpayment cost minus the sale price of house.
        Also, the tax saved from interest payments is also adjusted from the cost of EMI.
        \n\nSale price of house = Future value of house using the rate of appreciation
        \n\nCost of EMI = Future value of all the EMIs paid
        \n\nCost of down payment = Future value of the initial down payment
        \n\nInflation rate is used to calculate the future value of the costs.
    </string>
    <string name="house_return_explanation">To calculate XIRR from the house investment, below factors are considered:
        \n\n- Expected annual appreciation of the house.
        \n\n- Loan interest rate
        \n\n- Rental income
        \n\n- Tax savings from loan interest payments
        \n\nThe derivation of annualized return (XIRR) involves complex mathematical calculations.

    <string name="investment_return_explanation">The rate of return from the other investment is already approximated using
        which the future value is calculated. This can be compared directly with the returns from house investment
    </string>
    <string name="cost_of_rent_explanation">Cost of rent is calculated by adding all the future values of rent payments over a reference period.
        \n\nCost of rent = Future value of all the rent payments
        \n\nTo calculate the future value of the costs, average return of investment is used which was entered by you.
